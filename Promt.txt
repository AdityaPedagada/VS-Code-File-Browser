can you create new vs code extension  to browse files in the PC or remort ssh currently connected , in a grid formate folder icon and folder name and 3 different size icons and list of item in the folder, name last modified on, type, size , make sure extension run in the main window of vs code, add the address bar on top, by default load the current folder, give me the complete code with file name and and it content,

make sure it supports the dark mode and URL path is editable, and it should be in current directory and show me the suggestions while editing, give the toggle button to switch between the list and grid , and add all the possible actions on right click on file or folder , add back button near url bar to go to parrent folder and add the search text box to find the file or folder by name in the current folder

these are the files only i can browse i cant go to the any folder on  c drive or d drive or any other folder on computer there is no icon on back and list/grid button, escape is not working on action menu or suggestions, there is no space between the search bar and list/grid button, suggestions are overlapping the URL bar


when i right click on folder/ file old action popup is not closing

when i changing the tab open or current url is changing, right context menu is not functional, add the system context menu in context menu and it should be functional, chage the grid ui  proper grid with folder or file icon from the icon pack currently  working in vs code , show other details in grid also


icons are not loading , list ui changed , and add the icon in list, when no result found no responce is coming when we clearing the search box files are not updating , still the icons are not showing, add a option to create new folder/file, while renaming fill the old file name

after search cleared file details are (undefined NaN undefined Invalid Date), suggestions are appearing middle of the screen or in bottom , show the suggestions in the child folder when we put the slash (\) at the end of the URL, always put the slash at the end of the URL, suggestions  are not hiding when we leave the URl text box

while down arrow is pressed suggestions are not selecting when opened, while tab changes, page is reloading to default folder it should stay where it is
